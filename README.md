# Dynamic-Programming-Maximize-Grades
An exercise in dynamic programming in which an optimal solution is proposed for the issue of maximizing average grades by allocating study hours appropriately.

### The problem
You have *n* classes graded on a scale of 0-10 and the goal is to maximize the average grade across all classes. You have *H* hours (*H* > *n*) to study. Grades are determined by time spent studying for each course. 0-9 hours can be allocated to each course.
